    "text": "Projects / Work Experience\nThe first major research project I was involved with was as a student researcher in the Department of Orthopedics at University Hospitals. The project aimed to understand the use of retrograde intramedullary nails (rIMNs) in the fixation of pathologic femur fractures, as few studies have investigated the safety and efficacy of rIMN in the fixation of pathologic femur lesions. I was heavily involved with data mining and reviewing surgical records on REDCap to idenitfy those patients that received a retrograde as opposed to an antegrade intramedullary nail. The manuscript on the project has been submitted to various journals and our team is waiting to hear back currently.\nThe second major research project I have been involved with came through my position as a student researcher in the Department of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Sciences in the Lerner Research Institute. Klotho is a 130-kDa protein encoded by the KL gene that plays a role in the regulation of aging and longevity. Beyond its role in aging, Klotho has become an intriguing target for investigation in heart failure as Klotho deficiency exacerbates cardiac dysfunction and remodeling following cardiac injury. Hence, my project involved using a human soluble α-Klotho Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay Kit to compare human serum Klotho concentrations between patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and healthy controls. The data collection for this project is finished and our team is currently in the final stages of data analysis, preapring a manuscript to send for publication soon.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

I will also be joining the CWRU School of Medicine as an M1 in July 2025. My career interests lie in bio statistics and how we can utilize big data to help inform medicine and public health initiatives.\nDuring my undergraduate at CWRU, I obtained a Bachelor’s of Science in Biology while also competing on the Men’s Varsity Tennis Team. I have had immense research experience in working as a student researcher within University Hospital’s Department of Orthopedics and in the Department of Cardiovascular Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic’s Lerner Research Institute. I have also worked part-time as a patient transporter at University Hospitals and as a peer tutor in CWRU’s division of student affairs.\nOn this website, you will find a selection of my professional experiences as well as information on my current research projects. I invite you to explore my website and learn more about my work as a future public health professional. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"
